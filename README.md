कथा (kathaa) : A Visual Programming Framework for NLP Applications
=================================================================================

**Demo Video** : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woK5x0NmrUA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woK5x0NmrUA)

Kathaa is a Visual Programming Framework for NLP Applications.   
Although it was built for Sampark, it is highly flexible, and can accommodate any   
practically any other system, as long as you can safely represent the unit-task at
hand by a single function which takes some inputs, and spits out some outputs :D.   

The goal of this Framework is to empower researchers to design and tinker with
complex NLP workflows irrespective of their technical proficiency, and hopefully
to bridge the gap between Linguists and Computational Linguists.

The vision of this Framework is to make creation of NLP workflows as easy as
creating an online survey like Google Form (which in retrospect was a highly
  time and resource consuming task just a few years ago).

Installation
============
```
# Note : The whole installation expects Node engine  >= 5.x
# Please install the latest version of node from :
# https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
# Its really easy, I promise
# :)

git clone https://github.com/kathaa/kathaa 
cd kathaa
npm install .
grunt build

# Point to your MongoDB instance.
# If you mongo DB instance is running on localhost in default settings,
# then you can ignore this next step
export MONGOHQ_URL="mongodb://user:pass@your-mongo-server.some-domain.com:port_name/db_name"

#Make sure, redis is running on localhost

export NODE_ENV=development
#or NODE_ENV=production, in case of production mode

npm run seed
# this will ask you for the details of the Admin user, and seed the database
# with initial graphs

# Instantiate the module_library from the corresponding public github repos
# (If you want to add custom kathaa-module-groups, feel free to add them in package.json )
npm run install-kathaa-modules



# Copy and Edit environment parameters
cp config/env/env.example.json config/env/env.json

# In production setups, we would strongly recommend to run kue-sweeper
#
# Kue-sweeper regularly cleans out completed jobs, and makes sure your redis instance
# doesnt store more stuff than we require
#
./node_modules/kue-sweeper/forever-start-kue-sweep.sh


npm start

###
#
# You can also flush the mongodb database associated with your env by
# npm run flush_database


```

Extend
======
New Modules can be added by referencing the corresponding module-group in the `package.json` as shown in : https://github.com/kathaa/kathaa/blob/master/package.json#L7

 Inside every module_group, the individual modules must exist as folders, along with a `libraries.js` file for any shared libraries. 

the `package.json` file in the respective module folder defines the structure of the
module, and the `main` parameter in the `package.json` tells the module_library_loader
where to look for the function that the module is supposed to execute.

Look at examples in https://github.com/kathaa/core-modules/blob/master/custom_module/package.json and https://github.com/kathaa/core-modules/blob/master/custom_module/index.js
for templates for defining custom modules.


Pull requests for new modules-groups, or modules would be highly appreciated. Please get in touch with spmohanty91@gmail.com, if you have any interesting ideas !!
